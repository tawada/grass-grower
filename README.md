# README for Grass Grower

## Overview

Grass Grower is a Python application with a set of functionalities related to GitHub issues handling and documentation management. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently comment on issues and generate comprehensive `README.md` files.

## Features

- **Issue Interaction**: The application can fetch an issue from GitHub, read its content, and use an LLM to generate a detailed and contextual response which is then posted as a comment on the issue.
- **Documentation Automation**: It compiles the entire program code and uses the LLM to generate a `README.md` with a high-level understanding of the program's purpose and functionality.

## How It Works

The application consists of several Python modules that interact with each other to perform its tasks:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application that processes command-line arguments to trigger specific functionalities like `generate_readme` or `update_issue`.
- `routers`: Define the business logic of the application. It includes functions for generating the README and updating issues.
- `services`: Contains submodules that deal with external services such as GitHub (`github`) and Language Model interfacing (`llm`).
- `schemas`: Provides data structures for the application, in this case, defining an `Issue` class.

## Getting Started

Before you can run the Grass Grower, you'll need to have `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI) installed and configured on your system, as well as the necessary environment variables for OpenAI's API access.

To run the application, use the following commands:

```bash
python main.py generate_readme  # To generate README.md
python main.py update_issue     # To add a comment to an issue
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI's Python client library
- GitHub CLI tool (`gh`)

## Limitations

- Only fetches and interacts with the first issue it retrieves from GitHub.
- Dependent on OpenAI's API for text generation, which might introduce rate limits and costs.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for interacting with multiple issues simultaneously.
- Improved error handling and user feedback.
- Refinement of the text generation process to produce more targeted documentation.

## Conclusion

Grass Grower aims to reduce the manual effort involved in updating documentation and responding to issues. By automating these tasks, developers can focus more on coding and less on administrative tasks.

Please note that the information in the `README.md` is generated based on the current understanding of the program's capabilities and may not reflect all the existing features or future changes.
